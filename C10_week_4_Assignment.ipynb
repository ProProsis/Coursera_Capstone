Depending of course on the available data, the idea here is to select a place where there will be some Greek restaurants in order to increase the chances that the area might be known for Greek food and that may attract easier customers. While at the same time the existing the restaurants will not be rated very high to also increase the chances to establish a new restaurant known as one of the best options for Greek food in the area."
